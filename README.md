# Experiments in learning Kerasa

This is a Github repository that contains some from-scratch code that 
I've written to test my understanding both of ML models as well as 
learning Keras.

The general idea here is to re-implement tried and tested models like
the "hello, world" mnist handwritten digit recognizers to learn how
things are done using Keras.

I'm also really interested in how fast different GPU hardware performs
in training of the models, as well as hyper parameter tuning.
